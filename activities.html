<li><b><u>AICTE Sponsored Two Week Online Short Term Training Program on Sustainable Design of Chemical Process Plants 
by Using Aspen Plus and Aspen HYSYS Simulating Tools</u></b></br>
<b><u>Date:</u> 3 Aug 2020</b></br>
<b><u>Organized by:</u>Dr. K. Nagamalleswara Rao, Associate Professor</b></br>
<b><u> About Event:</u> Chemical Process plants such as refineries, pharmaceutical, chemical and petrochemical plants are 
very complex plants in terms of equipment, pipeline, electrical, instrumentation, control systems and power systems.
 Now a days, all industries must operate in a sustainable way to minimize environmental impacts while meeting the industry demands. 
 In operating the complex process plants, process safety is also the primary concern. Poor design or improper operator responses leads to 
 damaged equipment, loss of production, and even injuries or death. This training program provides hands-on sessions on sustainable design of process 
 plants using optimization and safe operating design procedures. Hands-on sessions planned in this training are helpful for techno-economic measures, 
 decision making, design and evaluation of chemical process plants.</b>

<li><b><u>CODECHEF</u></b></br>
<b><u>About Club:</u> CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms, computer programming and programming 
contests. At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a programming contest at the start of the month and another smaller
programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to algorithms, binary search, 
technicalities like array size and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for programming competitions, CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials 
and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of computer programming. Chapter provide a platform for practice, competition and improvement 
for both students and professional software developers. Apart from this, it aims to reach out to students while they are young and inculcate a culture of
