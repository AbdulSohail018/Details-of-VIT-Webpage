<p><b>A Master of Science is a master's degree in the field of science awarded by universities in many countries or a person holding such a degree.
In contrast to the Master of Arts degree, the Master of Science degree is typically granted for studies in sciences, engineering and medicine and is 
usually for programs that are more focused on scientific and mathematical subjects; however, different universities have different conventions and 
may also offer the degree for fields typically considered within the humanities and social sciences</b></p>
